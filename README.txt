OOSE Game by Moritz Bergemann
Last Updated: 22/05/2020

REQUIREMENTS - Java 11
NOTE - this game uses a graphical user interface and therefore cannot be run purely from a terminal

Compiling/Running the program:
- The program is run/compiled using the gradlew script. For the following steps, use 'gradlew' if on Linux/MacOS and
    'gradlew.bat' if on Windows.
- To compile and then run the program, enter "gradle run" or "gradle".
    - The first time performing this may take some time as Gradle downloads the JavaFX plugin. Subsequent runs will be
        faster.
- The program uses the file 'items.txt' to get information about the items in this game, which should be populated as
    per the assignment specification. This file should be in the root directory of the program (the same place as the
    'src' folder and gradlew scripts).
